#### Sentiment Analysis of tweets 

This repository contains a sentiment analysis project that harnesses the power of natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of tweets. The goal of this project is to classify tweets into different sentiment categories, such as positive, negative, or neutral, utilizing machine learning and NLP techniques.
Overview

In today's digital age, social media platforms like Twitter have become significant sources of real-time opinions, emotions, and trends. Understanding the sentiment behind tweets is crucial for various applications, including brand monitoring, market analysis, and gauging public opinion on diverse topics.

This project [employs Python, NLTK, Bag of Words, TensorFlow etc.] to preprocess, analyze, and classify tweets based on their sentiment. The trained model provides insights into the emotional tone of the text, allowing for deeper understanding and interpretation of the vast amount of information available on social media platforms.
